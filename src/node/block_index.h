    //! disjoint from BLOCK_HAVE_DATA. Pre-F1 the bit overlap meant
    //! BLOCK_HAVE_DATA-only blocks accidentally satisfied the candidate

    //! v4.3.3 F14 (Layer-3 round 2 LOW-2 / MEDIUM-3): canonical block-receipt

    //! arrived full block (P2P receipt, validation queue, orphan-resolve, local
    //! mining, etc.). Combines the F1 OR-merge of BLOCK_HAVE_DATA with the F7
    //! RaiseValidity to BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS into ONE atomic-meaning op.
    //!
    //! Why a helper: pre-F14 the F1+F7 pattern was open-coded at 5 production
    //! sites (block_processing, block_validation_queue ×2, dilithion-node ×2,
    //! dilv-node). Layer-3 round 2 flagged that future code changes could
    //! remove the F7 RaiseValidity call without breaking T1.7 (which tests
    //! the helper, not the call sites) — silent regression to the canary-3
    //! chain-stall state. F14 makes the contract explicit: "call this; both
    //! flags get set together; never duplicate the pattern."
    //!
    //! Idempotent: second call sees BLOCK_HAVE_DATA already set and validity
    //! already at TRANSACTIONS, so no mutation. Safe under retry / replay.
    //!
    //! ENFORCEMENT POLICY (Cursor v4.3.3 review S13 LOW, 2026-05-04):
    //! Future block-receipt sites: DO NOT open-code
    //! `nStatus |= BLOCK_HAVE_DATA`. Always call
    //! `pindex->MarkBlockReceived()`. The ONLY legitimate places that
    //! still write the HAVE_DATA bit directly are:
    //!   1. `dilithion-node.cpp:2507` / `dilv-node.cpp:2394` — genesis
    //!      bootstrap (`nStatus = BLOCK_VALID_CHAIN | BLOCK_HAVE_DATA`).
    //!      Genesis is a one-shot bootstrap event, not a "received" event;
    //!      validity is BLOCK_VALID_CHAIN by definition (the active-chain
    //!      block at h=0). Do NOT replace these with MarkBlockReceived.
    //!   2. `chain.cpp:1718` / F2 — `ConnectTip` ORs HAVE_DATA on
    //!      successful connect AS A BACKSTOP for header-first paths
    //!      where MarkBlockReceived didn't fire (e.g., ProcessNewHeader
    //!      created the index). This is intentional defense-in-depth.
    //!
    //! Code review for any change touching block_processing.cpp,
    //! block_validation_queue.cpp, dilithion-node.cpp, dilv-node.cpp, or
    //! any new block-ingress path MUST verify MarkBlockReceived is the
    //! ONLY way HAVE_DATA reaches a freshly-allocated CBlockIndex. The
    //! 3 exceptions above are exhaustive.
    //!
    //! If you need a different validity level (rare), use
    //! `RaiseValidity(level)` directly with a comment explaining why.
