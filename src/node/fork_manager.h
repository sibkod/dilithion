/**
 * @brief Singleton manager for fork validation and chain switching
 *
 * ## Port-survival note (Phase 7 v0.3, 2026-05-01)
 *
 * The ForkManager + ForkCandidate pair is a Dilithion-specific
 * consensus-adjacent layer that wraps chain_selector. It is NOT present
 * in upstream Bitcoin Core: upstream relies on max-cumulative-work
 * selection alone, accepting transient reorg windows that the
 * 2026-04-25 incident demonstrated are unsafe at Dilithion's current
 * scale and miner topology. Validate-Before-Disconnect (this class) is
 * how Dilithion mitigates that.
 *
 * This file SURVIVES the v4.1 port via the LEGACY block-receive path.
 * Fork-staging fires when block_processing::ProcessNewBlock is invoked
 * (9 sites: dilithion-node.cpp x3, dilv-node.cpp x3, ibd_coordinator.cpp x3).
 * Post v4.3.4 Option C cut, all operational paths use the legacy
 * entry points (the port-CPeerManager-driven HandleBlock path that
 * could have bypassed fork-staging was retired in Block 6, and the
 * port::CPeerManager class itself was deleted in Block 7). Fork-
 * staging is therefore fully operational on every block-arrival path
 * under all flag values. The "Path A1 vs Path A2" bypass concern that
 * existed pre-cut is moot — there is no bypass path remaining.
 * Retirement of this file clusters with `ibd_coordinator` retirement
 * if/when v5 architectural review revisits IBD orchestration; see
 * `.claude/contracts/v5_architecture_decision_prep.md`.
 *
 * ## What ForkManager does
 *
 * The ForkManager implements "validate before disconnect" - fork blocks
 * are staged and pre-validated (PoW + MIK) before any chain changes occur.
 *
 * ## Workflow:
 * 1. Fork detected via header differences (in IBDCoordinator)
 * 2. CreateForkCandidate() called to start staging
 * 3. Blocks arrive and are routed to AddBlockToFork()
 * 4. Each block is pre-validated (PoW + MIK via PreValidateBlock)
 * 5. When all blocks received and pre-validated:
 *    - TriggerChainSwitch() calls ActivateBestChain
 *    - ActivateBestChain handles WAL, UTXO, disconnect/connect
 * 6. If any block fails pre-validation:
 *    - CancelFork() is called
 *    - Original chain remains untouched
 *
 * ## Thread Safety:
 * All methods are thread-safe via internal mutex.
 *
 * ## Key Principle:
 * The current chain is NEVER disconnected until ALL fork blocks
 * are pre-validated and ready for activation.
